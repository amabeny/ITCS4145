# Merge Sort in C++

## Overview
This program implements the Merge Sort algorithm in C++. It accepts an array size as a command-line argument, generates random data, sorts it using Merge Sort, and prints the time taken.

## Prerequisites
- C++ compiler (e.g., `g++`)
- Make utility

## Compilation
To compile the program, run:
make

## Usage
Run the executable with the desired array size:
./mergesort <array_size>
Example:
./mergesort 10000
This will generate 10,000 random integers, sort them, and print the execution time.

## Cleaning Up
To remove the compiled executable, run:
./mergesort 10000
